                Freely transform between your spaceship mode and
                robot mode (As long as you have ground to land on) to switch not only forms but also genres!

                        <b>Spaceship Form - Arcade Shmup:</b> Play a fast-paced on-the-rails "shoot-em-up" vertical scrolling shooter in
                        the vein of classic arcade titles such as Galaga or Gradius.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Robot Form - Twin-Stick Omnidirectional Shooter:</b> Play a a more methodical off-the-rails shooter akin to
                        arcade classics like Robotron: 2084 that not only packs significant fire-power, it also lets you move in any direction even backtracking the smhup map!
                        <br /> You could even explore indoor dungeons your spaceship would crash in!
