                Screen-clearing bombs are a common sight in many shmups, however Phoenix Missiles are much more fun.
                <br />Instead of a simple click followed by a boom killing all enemies, Phoenix Missiles instead freeze time so the 
                player can strategize and express skillful planning.
                <br />(<b>Tip:</b> Corvette enemies have a 100% drop chance for Phoenix Missiles. Use this to your advantage in the boss fight!)
                <p /><b>How To Use:</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Pick up the glowing red bombs with a P on them to gain a Phoenix Missile.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Right click to freeze time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Left click to set each waypoint you want the missile to fly through.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After picking the final waypoint, the Phoenix Missile launches and destroys enemies within its path!
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}
