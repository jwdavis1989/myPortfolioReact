                This talent is a powerful increase to the Firelord Talent, doubling its potential effect.
                <br />Revisiting the Fire Lord examples:
                <p /><b>Example 1:</b> Aganazzarâ€™s Scorcher affects creatures within a <b>5</b> feet by <b>30</b> feet line, 
                allowing it to potentially strike up to 6 creatures if they are lined up.
                <br />With this talent, that line becomes <b>15</b> foot wide by <b>40</b> foot long as all dimensions are increased. 
                <br />The new area of effect can potentially affect as many as 24 creatures!

                <p /><b>Example 2:</b> Fireball affects creatures within a <b>20</b> foot radius sphere
                centered on a point within 150 feet. This affects a volume of <b>33510.32</b> feet.
                <br />With this talent, the radius of the sphere increases to a <b>30</b> foot radius, affecting a volume of <b>113,097</b> feet!
                
                <p /><b>Example 3:</b> Burning Hand affects creatures within a <b>15</b> feet cone.
                <br />With Fire Lord, this spell now affects creatures within a <b>25</b> feet cone.
                <p />Additionally, remember that this effect actually improves your Combustion 
                Talent's effect significantly as a larger area of effect means significantly more Magma.

                Sometimes, the situation may not allow for you to expand the area of effect of your 
                spells without risking yourself or your allies.
                <br />Letting the player choose from +0ft, +5ft, or +10ft to all area of effect dimensions 
                gives them flexible dials to tone the destruction up or down as needed.

                This further showcases the user's mastery over Fire magic, 
                and allows for some truly maniacal power moments when combined with Combustion.
