\b0 1. Versatile Weapon Fighting's T3 talent buffed on 2handed damage due to high stat-requirements for the weapon type.\par
5. Ranged Weapon Fighting - Crossbows/firearms reworked, now shoots singular high-powered shots that penetrate armor if you spend a bonus action through Dexterity Save mechanics.\par
6. 4 new types of Armor that will appear in stores/shops added to the Player Handbook.\par
7. 14 new types of Weapons that will appear in stores/shops added to the Player Handbook. This includes everything from Scythes, to Shotguns, to DMRs, Kunais, Katanas, Pistols, SMGs, Assault Rifles, etc. \par
All are mechanically identical to weapons from the base game, but with theming tweaks that make sense mechanically.\par
8. Six new Corporations added to the Player Handbook that manufacture the above mentioned armor and weapons, each with their unique flare and theming.\line\b\line Update 3/20/20 Transmutation Added:\b0\line 1. Geomancy T3 talent now turns all bludgeoning spells into Bludgeoning/Earth spells. \line 2. Transmutation Added, a magic school focused on tweaking the traits and shapes of the material world.\par
\b\line Updates 3/22/20 Chimerism Added:\par
\b0 1. Added the Talented refilling flasks from alchemy talent to the list of items in the player hand book.\par

10. Geomancy Spell list finished except lvl 7 has no spells until I homebrew some. @Relovash\par
11. Pyromancy Spell list finished\line 12. Hydro: Rain Dance and Rainlord talents swapped.\par
13. Rainlord buffed to 2 5ft squares per 1 point in Hydro.\line\b\line Update Thrown Weapon Revert:\par
\b0 1. Dual Weapons thrown ranged reverted from 20/40ft back to vanilla ranges of 20/60ft.\b\line\line Update 4/2/20 Warforged & Artificer Changes:\par
\b0 Construct races such as warforged will now be treated further appropriately as constructs.\par
This means the following:\par
1. They do not receive healing from magic.\par
2. They have immunity to poison damage, instead of only resistance.\par
3. Warforged may no longer permanently die unless their body is disintegrated, however it would require a skilled artificer of 6 skill allocation to rebuild one over a period of two weeks should they fully fail 3 death saving throws while downed. (Which is normally perma-death)\par
4. A very special vendor near and dear to some players' hearts will be offering schematic upgrades to the Artifice Skill Tree's Welding Torch, which require Artifice levels to be able to craft. These will ensure that the flavor will be maintained, but some of the downside reduced by the increasing upsides of construct race repairing features.\par
\line\b\tab Why:\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\li720\b0 My hope is to further immerse players in the game through more realistic differences in synthetic/biological races, and that this will also give players interested in Artifice exceptional ways to show off their incredible crafting capabilities.\par

\pard\nowidctlpar\par
Additionally, this will yield yet another series of potential items to buy within the various shops of the game, Schematics/Inspiration.\line\b\line Update 4/12/20 Dual Weapon Fighting 1.0:\par
\b0 1. DW Fighting +1 effect nerfed, +5ft speed per 2 points instead of per 1 point.\par
2. DW's Successive Blows doubled in strength, but moved from T9 to T12.\par
3. DW Tier 9 added, Graceful Waltz.\par
4. DW Tier 15 added, Flourish.\par
5. DW Tier 18 added, Crescendo.\par
6. DW Tier 20 added, Encore!\par
7. DW's Flurry renamed to Blade Dance.\par
8. DW's Successive Blows renamed to Rising Tempo.\line\b\line Updates  4/13/20 Final Talent Level & Martial Weapon Tweaks:\b0\par
1. Final talents now exist as T18 talents, however you still get +2 talent points at character level 20, however, you still have the ability to put skill points into a skill tree until it is 20 to continue to gain the +1 bonus.\par
2. DW Fighting: Crescendo removed as T18, replaced by the old T20, Encore!.\par
3. Longarm Weapon T6 changed to Charge, which grants bonus damage when charging with a longarm.\par
4. Longarm Weapon T9 added, a remade Talon Strike that is now about performing a mobile jumping attack.\par
5. Versatile Weapon T9, Honed Reflexes added, granting the ability to reduce the damage of and possibly catch ranged projectiles.\par

Geomancy\rquote s T15 Talent, Titan Skin, reworked into Earthlord. \highlight1\lang1033 You may now cast the\~{\highlight0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://thebombzen.com/grimoire/spells/mold-earth" }}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf3\cf3\highlight1\ul Mold Earth}}}}\f0\fs22\~cantrip as a Bonus Action, it has no limitations on how many effects you may have simultaneously, and it affects an area of a 10ft cube instead of only a 5ft cube. However, it may no longer grant you Stonefist.\par
\highlight0\b Dev Thoughts:\b0  \line I have been imagining Geomancy as a zone control/tanky mage that skews towards physical damage hybridization, and while Terra Slam helped some, now a Geomancer can Terra Slam -> Stonefist -> Terra Slam on one target for example for 3 straight turns in a row of messing with the enemy's positioning tactics. Additionally, this furthers its underlining implied synergy with Pyromancy. And lastly, this differentiates the specialization from Abjuration more, as it's meant to be a bit like abjuration-lite, with zone control mixed in.\par
